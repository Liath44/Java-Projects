# Java-Projects
Hi
This repository is used to hold Java projects that were done by me during the course of my Objective Programming and Java classes. The intent of it is to showcase my progress and capabilities in subject matters.
Few things worth noting:
1) Most of the projects are done in Polish - Quite understandable considering my descent though irritating for foreign readers. It's doubtful i'll ever want to refactor it.
2) By default i'm using IntelliJ as my Java IDE therefore project files have IntelliJ stuff inside them.
3) Though projects lack ToDo comment there are things that need to be done regarding some of them (adding comments, general improvements, explaining purpose etc.). Sooner or later it will be done.
4) Feedback is greately appreciated: maciek_dra@wp.pl
